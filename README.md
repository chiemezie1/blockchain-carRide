# blockchain-carRide
This project is a smart contract for a car ride sharing service. The contract includes a mechanism to verify the identities of drivers and riders, a rating system to ensure high-quality drivers and riders are able to secure more rides, and additional safety checks to ensure that payments are only made and received once a ride is completed.
